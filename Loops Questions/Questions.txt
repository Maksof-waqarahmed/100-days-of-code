1) Given an array of integers, count the number of even numbers. Use the most appropriate method or loop to solve this problem.
2) Given an array of numbers, create a new array where each value is doubled. Determine the most suitable method to use.
3) Given an array of integers, find the first negative number in the array. If there is no negative number, return null.
4) Given an array of integers, sum the numbers until the first negative number is encountered. If there are no negative numbers, sum all the numbers.
5) Given an array of strings, check if a specific string is present in the array. Return true if it is present, otherwise return false.
6) Given an array of user names, create an array of greeting messages for each user. For example, if the input 
7) Given an array of numbers, calculate the sum of all elements using a while loop.
8) Given an array of strings, concatenate all the strings into a single string.
9) Given an array with duplicate elements, create a new array with duplicates removed.
10) Write a function that repeatedly performs an action until a condition is met. For example, generate a random number between 1 and 10 until you get a 7.
11) Given an array of numbers, find the maximum value in the array.
12) Given an array of numbers, extract all even numbers and calculate their sum.
13) Given an array of any type (numbers, strings, etc.), reverse the order of elements in the array.
14) Given an array of numbers and a specific value, count how many times that value appears in the array.
15) Given an array of numbers, create a new array where each value is squared.
16) Given an array of numbers and a specific value, find all indices where the value appears.
17) Given an array of objects where each object has a name property, create an array containing just the names.
18) Given an array of numbers, find the average of all the numbers in the array.
19) Given an array of strings, create an object that counts the frequency of each string.
20) Given an array containing nested arrays, flatten it into a single array.
21) Given an array of numbers and a threshold value, remove all elements that are greater than the threshold.
22) Given an array of objects where each object has a type property, group the objects by type.
24) Given an array of items with different categories, count how many items there are in each category.
24) Given several arrays, merge them into a single array.
25) You want to loop through an array of tasks and stop when you encounter a task marked as "completed."
26) Write a do...while loop to prompt the user to enter a number and continue prompting until the user enters a number greater than 10.
27) Write a do...while loop that continues to sum up user-entered numbers until the user inputs a negative number. After exiting the loop, display the total sum.
